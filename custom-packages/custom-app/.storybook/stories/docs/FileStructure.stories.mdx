# File structure

Installing Craftable Pro will create two Vite aliases

-   `craftable-pro` for loading most of the Craftable components from the vendor folder
-   `@` pointing to resources folder in your project, where are located some of the components for better customizability

## Craftable components

Craftable components are located in the vednor folder. This way we can ensure their updateability. Bellow is the file structure for better orientation:

```
vendor/brackets/craftable-pro/resources/js
├── Components/
├── helpers/
├── hooks/
├── Layouts/
├── Pages/
├── plugins/
└── types/
```

## Project components

Installing Craftable Pro will copy some of the components to your project. This way you can customize them to your needs. Bellow is the file structure for better orientation:

```
resource/js/craftable-pro
├── Components/
│   ├── Logo.vue (used to customize content of the logo)
│   ├── Sidebar.vue (used to customize content of the sidebar)
│   └── UserDropdown.vue (used to customize content of the user dropdown menu)
├── Pages/
├── index.ts
└── shims-vue.d.ts
```
