# Listing component

This is a documentation for `Listing` component

## Default usage (without slots)

Simply pass the data and columns props. Listing will show data based on columns array.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="listing-listing--default" />
</Canvas>

## With slots

If default behaviour is not enough for your needs, you can use prepared slots to define table header and table row using slots `#tableHead` and `#tableRow`. It's recommended to use `ListingHeaderCell` and `ListingDataCell` components for this as well, since these components has some predefined styles.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="listing-listing--with-slots" />
</Canvas>
